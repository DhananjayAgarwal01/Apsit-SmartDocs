# College Document Automation System

---

## 1. Project Overview

A unified system to streamline and automate the creation of college reports, notices, and official documents—with consistent branding, efficient workflows, and AI-enhanced content generation.

---

## 2. Objectives

- **Automation & Efficiency:**  
  Eliminate repetitive manual work using templates, automation, and AI.

- **Brand Consistency:**  
  Ensure every document maintains standardized college logo, header, footer, and style.

- **Support for Non-Technical Users:**  
  Enable fast, error-free document creation through user-friendly interfaces.

- **Security & Access Control:**  
  Protect documents and personal data with authentication and role-based permissions.

- **Document Archival:**  
  Store generated documents for search, compliance, and auditing.

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1 Template Management

- Admins design, edit, and save reusable templates.
- Templates include logo position, sections, fields, and signatures.

### 3.2 Manual Entry and Image Upload

- Interactive forms for entering document-specific information (title, date, purpose, recipient, etc.).
- Upload and embed images and signatures within document sections.

### 3.3 AI-Powered Text Generation

- Use open-source/free models (Llama 2/3, Mistral, GPT-Neo/J, Hugging Face Free Tier) to:
  - Generate formal text
  - Paraphrase or summarize inputs
  - Suggest refined content for reports and notices

### 3.4 Real-Time Preview & PDF Export

- Live preview of the formatted document, including images and logo.
- Generates a branded PDF for download or printing using `pdf-lib`.

### 3.5 Role-Based Access & Security

- JWT- and OAuth-based authentication.
- Admin/user roles restricting template management vs. document creation.

### 3.6 File Handling

- Upload, store, and embed media within documents.
- Supports resizing and cropping images for perfect placement.

## 4. Development Workflow

1. **Project Initialization**
   - Set up separate React (frontend) and Express (backend) projects.
   - Configure MongoDB and environment variables for secrets/connection strings.
   - Initialize Git for version control.

2. **Free AI Model Selection**
   - Choose free/opensource model (Llama 3, Mistral, GPT-Neo/J).
   - Decide: API-based (Hugging Face free tier) or local (Ollama/LM Studio).

3. **Frontend Development**
   - Build login/signup (JWT, OAuth optional).
   - Dashboard for document listing and creation.
   - Document editor (fields, image upload, AI text area, preview pane).
   - PDF export/download button.

4. **Backend Development**
   - Implement authentication (JWT, later OAuth).
   - CRUD APIs for templates, users, documents.
   - File/image upload endpoints.
   - PDF generation endpoint.
   - Connect/route AI text generation API/model requests.

5. **PDF Generation**
   - Use `pdf-lib` to fill templates, embed images, and generate PDFs.
   - Ensure logo and formatting match college branding.

6. **Role Management**
   - Admin: template management, document approval.
   - User: document creation and editing only.

7. **Testing**
   - Manual testing: login, document creation, preview, AI suggestion, PDF export.
   - Automated tests for APIs and UI components as skills allow.

8. **Deployment**
   - Prepare for deployment to free/low-cost cloud OR intranet server.
   - MongoDB Atlas free tier for database management.
   - Deploy frontend (Netlify, Vercel, or college server).

9. **Documentation & Handover**
   - Document endpoints, setup, and user workflows.
   - Write clear code comments and onboarding manuals.

## 6. Sample User Flow

1. Faculty logs in with email/password (JWT) or via OAuth (Google).
2. Selects "Create Document" and chooses a template.
3. Fills in required fields, uploads images, and requests content suggestions via AI.
4. Previews the formatted document.
5. Exports to PDF or submits for admin approval.

## 7. Additional Recommendations

- Start with only essential features (MVP), then incrementally add advanced options.
- Use open-source and free tools throughout to avoid vendor lock-in.
- Share and edit this markdown as your **living project blueprint**—keep updating as new requirements or experiences arise.
